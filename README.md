# URL Shortener â€“ Open Source Project

This is an open source project for a URL shortener with additional features such as:

- (Planned) Password protection  
- (Planned) Link expiration dates  
- (Working) Access statistics  

Both the backend and frontend are being developed publicly from the very beginning. The goal is to deliver a simple, secure, and functional solution while sharing the entire development process for educational and collaborative purposes.

ðŸš€ An experimental version is available at: https://url-shortener.up.railway.app/

Due to limited personal availability, progress may be gradual, but the project will be completed and maintained with care. Community participation is welcome at every stage.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** React + Vite, organized in modular components, pages, and UI primitives.
- **Hooks:** Custom hooks should be placed in `src/hooks` for reusable logic.
- **Services:** API and business logic are in `src/service`.
- **Testing:** Automated tests should be placed in `__tests__` using Jest and React Testing Library.
